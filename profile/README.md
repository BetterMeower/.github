# BetterMeower is taking a break
BetterMeower is currently unavailable while we work on our CL4 rewrite. Want to help get BetterMeower up and running faster? Feel free to send an email to hello@bettermeower.app, and you can join our team!

# Rewrite FAQs
## How long will the rewrite take?
However long it takes to port our new features to CL4 Meower Svelte once it's released. Once that is complete, we will release a public beta to test BetterMeower while we start adding new features just for the CL4 port.
## How can I help with the rewrite?
Send an email to hello@bettermeower.app. Someone on our team will be happy to give you some more information, and you can also ask to join the BetterMeower team from there, although work on BetterMeower will not resume until the CL4 Meower Svelte port is stable.
## Can I use BetterMeower right now on the CL3 server?
No, BetterMeower is not officially hosted anywhere. If you've got a local copy of BetterMeower, that will continue to work until the CL4 server is deployed. Do not use BetterMeower on any sites other than on https://bettermeower.app, or any bettermeower.app subdomain, as the BetterMeower team usually cannot audit the code to ensure it is safe to use.
## Can I use BetterMeower to bypass IP bans?
**No**, we do not endorse ban evasion and are strongly against it. Anyone using BetterMeower to evade bans will be permanently IP banned from BetterMeower and will have the associated IP reported to the Meower team.
## What about the BetterMeower Testing Server?
The BetterMeower testing server will remain as a functional CL3 Meower Server with a client at https://testing.bettermeower.app. We plan to transition the server to CL4 once we have a functional CL4 BetterMeower rewrite.
## I have a question not listed here
Send us an email to hello@bettermeower.app, and someone on our team will happily answer your question.
